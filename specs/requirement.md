# Plan Manager

## Vision

Plan Manager is a lightweight Git-native web application running locally on the developer machine.

Instead of browsing plans through Git branches and folders, users can manage them through a Kanban-style interface while still keeping everything in Git.

## Core Concepts

### Repository

A local Git repository registered with Plan Manager.

### Plan

A Plan is represented by a directory in machine under a configured location:

plans/{service}/{ticket-id}/
├── README.md # Overview, glossary, data flow, design decisions
├── scenario/ # Business context and overall workflow
│ ├── scenario-00-overview.md
│ └── scenario-NN-{description}.md
├── design/
│ ├── design-0N-backend.md
│ ├── design-0N-frontend.md
│ └── design-0N-infrastructure.md
└── implementation-plan.md # Phase-by-phase with draft commit per phase

Repositories may define their own plan structure through a repository configuration file. When no custom configuration is provided, Plan Manager falls back to the default plans/ structure described above.

Plan Manager automatically discovers, indexes, and visualizes plans across branches, enabling teams to browse, review, edit, and track planning artifacts in a unified interface.
