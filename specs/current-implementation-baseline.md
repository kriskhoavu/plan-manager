# Plan Manager Requirement (Current Implementation Baseline)

This document defines the currently implemented product scope, based on
`plans/platform/current-spec/*`.

## 1. Vision and Scope

Plan Manager is a local Git-native web application for managing planning artifacts
from one or more Git workspaces. It provides Kanban, explorer, and item-level
editing workflows while keeping all source-of-truth data in Git repositories.

The system is single-user and local-first:

- the server binds to loopback only (`127.0.0.1`)
- API and frontend are served from one local process
- no remote hosting behavior is required by default

## 2. Runtime and Composition Requirements

### 2.1 CLI and Server Runtime

- The CLI must support `plan-manager serve [-port]`.
- Default port is `4317`.
- If `-port` is not provided, `PLAN_MANAGER_PORT` must be used when set.
- Server must expose JSON API under `/api/*` and serve the SPA frontend.
- Unknown top-level frontend routes must resolve to Kanban behavior.

Core runtime endpoints must include:

- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/state`
- `GET /api/workspaces`

`GET /api/state` must return a version hash derived from workspace records and
indexed item data.

### 2.2 Frontend Route Baseline

The app shell must provide these routes:

- `/kanban`
- `/explorer`
- `/workspaces`
- `/items/{itemId}`

### 2.3 Service Wiring

Runtime composition must include services for:

- Git operations
- workspace registry
- item indexing
- scanning
- guarded file access and writing
- audit events
- health/reliability checks
- search
- navigation recents
- API route mounting

## 3. Core Domain Concepts

### 3.1 Workspace

A workspace is a registered local Git repository with metadata:

- `id`, `name`, `path`, `baselineBranch`, `lastSelectedBranch`, `sources`
- `createdAt`, `lastScannedAt`

### 3.2 Source

A source is a workspace-relative directory used for item discovery.

### 3.3 Item

An item is a discovered planning unit indexed from source content.

Two item categories must be supported:

- structured items (folder-based, metadata-driven)
- docs-root items (Markdown-root fallback, metadata source `docs`)

### 3.4 Branch Context

Kanban and explorer behavior must respect per-workspace branch context, with
support for working-tree and snapshot reads.

## 4. Workspace Registration and Validation

### 4.1 CRUD

Workspace CRUD endpoints must exist:

- `GET /api/workspaces`
- `POST /api/workspaces`
- `PUT /api/workspaces/{id}`
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}`

### 4.2 Validation Rules

On create/update, the system must validate:

- `name` is provided
- `path` resolves to a Git repository root
- `baselineBranch` exists
- each source path is relative and exists within workspace root

### 4.3 System Path Helpers

The workspace UI must be supported by:

- `POST /api/system/select-directory`
- `POST /api/system/open-path`

## 5. Source Configuration, Discovery, and Indexing

### 5.1 Source Settings

Per-source settings may be defined via `workspace-settings.yaml`.

Requirements:

- support one or more card rules (`pathPattern` + `fields`)
- accept canonical fields (`source`, `item`) and aliases (`scope`, `identifier`)
- accept legacy filename `repository-settings.yaml`
- support literal and `{variable}` path segments
- return warnings for invalid settings without blocking fallback scanning

Source settings endpoints must exist:

- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/source-structure?directory={dir}`
- `PUT /api/workspaces/{id}/source-structure?directory={dir}`
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}/source-structure?directory={dir}`

The source-structure read response must include:

- mode: `structured`, `unstructured`, `empty`, or `unknown`
- inferred proposals
- preview rows for mapped item fields

### 5.2 Discovery Order

Scanning must evaluate each source in this order:

1. valid configured rules from settings
2. structured traversal (`{source}/{scope}/{identifier}`)
3. freestyle docs-root fallback

Structured item detection must support:

- folder contains `plan.yaml`, or
- folder name matches identifier-like uppercase pattern (for example `PM-012`)

### 5.3 Metadata Extraction

Scanner/index behavior must support:

- metadata from `plan.yaml` (`identifier`, `scope`, `title`, `status`, `owner`, `tags`)
- title from README heading fallback
- description from first README paragraph fallback
- inferred document list from Markdown paths and roles
- `plan.yaml` document override merge by path

Status normalization must support:

- `unsorted`, `draft`, `in_progress`, `review`, `done`

### 5.4 Docs-Root Fallback

If structured layout does not apply and source root contains Markdown files:

- one docs item must be created for that source root
- item status must be `unsorted`
- metadata source must be `docs`

### 5.5 Item Index Storage

Index state must be persisted in `item-index.yaml` and support:

- replace by workspace scan
- replace by workspace+branch scan
- query by workspace, branch, status, and text
- direct item detail lookup by ID
- branch scan metadata persistence

Deleting a workspace must remove its workspace record and indexed items.

### 5.6 Branch-Aware Scanning

Scanning must support:

- working-tree mode (filesystem reads)
- snapshot mode (Git tree object reads)
- stable item IDs for workspace + branch + item path identity

## 6. Kanban Board and Item Lifecycle

### 6.1 Board Scope and Branch Loading

Route `/kanban` must operate on one active workspace.

Branch loading endpoint:

- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/kanban/branch`

Returned branch context must include:

- selected branch
- resolved ref/commit
- current checkout branch
- source mode: `working_tree` or `snapshot`
- editability flag
- branch-scoped item list
- scan warnings

Supporting endpoints:

- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/git/status`
- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/git/branches`

Board branch UX must support local branch listing with checkout indicator,
branch-switch refresh without implicit checkout, and explicit manual refresh.

### 6.2 Filters and Saved Views

Kanban filtering must support:

- source
- scope
- status
- author
- free-text query

Saved filter APIs must support create/list/delete:

- `GET /api/saved-filters`
- `POST /api/saved-filters`
- `DELETE /api/saved-filters/{id}`

Saved filter payload must support route, optional workspace scope, and serialized
filter/query state.

### 6.3 Columns and Card Rules

Board columns must follow status order:

- `unsorted`, `draft`, `in_progress`, `review`, `done`

Card behavior requirements:

- docs-root cards are visible but not draggable
- structured cards support status changes
- preview drawer opens via click/keyboard
- title opens `/items/{itemId}`

### 6.4 Status Updates

Status update endpoint:

- `PATCH /api/items/{id}/status`

Interaction and safety requirements:

- support drag/drop and menu-based status update
- optimistic move while request is pending
- per-card pending lock against duplicate updates
- rollback on failure
- block dropping into `unsorted`
- block docs-root item mutation

### 6.5 Snapshot Materialization

When an item originates from snapshot mode and a write action is attempted,
the UI must request explicit confirmation.

Confirmed requests must include `materializeConfirmed: true` so backend can
materialize into checkout branch before applying write.

### 6.6 Item Creation

Kanban must support new structured item creation:

- `POST /api/items`

Creation flow must allow source, identifier, title, and initial status selection.

## 7. Item Workspace Requirements

### 7.1 Route and Initial Loading

Route `/items/{itemId}` must load:

- `GET /api/items/{id}`
- `GET /api/items/{id}/files`
- `GET /api/items/{id}/diff`
- `GET /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/git/status`

Selected file content must load via:

- `GET /api/items/{id}/files/{fileID}`

### 7.2 File Workspace UI Model

The item workspace must provide:

- left panel: file tree and in-item content search
- center panel: preview/raw/diff tabs
- right panel: item metadata or Git controls

File tree must support recursive navigation, keyboard/pointer selection, and file
state indicators from Git and unsaved edits.

### 7.3 In-Item Content Search

Endpoint:

- `GET /api/items/{id}/content-search?q=...`

Behavior:

- debounced query
- minimum length 2
- results include line/column/snippet
- selecting result opens file at matched coordinates

### 7.4 Editing and Autosave

File editing must support shared editor session behavior:

- debounced autosave (default 900ms)
- save state: pending, saving, saved, error
- save-before-navigation when unsaved changes exist

Save endpoint:

- `POST /api/items/{id}/files/{fileID}` with `content`, `expectedHash`

Backend write guards must enforce:

- path is within item root and configured sources
- stale hash blocks blind overwrite
- unsupported/binary content is rejected

Revert endpoint:

- `POST /api/items/{id}/files/{fileID}/revert`

### 7.5 Metadata Editing

Metadata endpoint:

- `PATCH /api/items/{id}/metadata`

Rules:

- docs-root items are metadata read-only
- structured items support title/scope/identifier/status/owner/tags updates
- successful metadata writes must refresh workspace scan/index state

### 7.6 Diff and Git Controls

Diff endpoint:

- `GET /api/items/{id}/diff`

UI requirements:

- parsed review mode and raw diff mode
- single-file revert from selected file context

Workspace Git actions in item workspace must support:

- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/git/fetch`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/git/pull`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/git/push`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/git/commit`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/git/branches`

Git panel must show branch/ahead-behind/dirty-conflict state, changed path
selection for commit, commit validation, and branch creation with optional
checkout.

## 8. Global Explorer Requirements

### 8.1 Scope and Route State

Route `/explorer` must display all registered workspaces and persist selection in
query state (`workspaceId`, `path`, `mode`).

### 8.2 Tree Modes and Directory Loading

Explorer must support:

- `sources` mode (default)
- `all` mode (full repository tree)

Mode must be persisted locally and reflected in route state.

Directory loading endpoint:

- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/tree?path={dir}&includeIgnored={bool}`

Directory loading constraints:

- lazy one-level child loading
- hide `.git` and protected paths
- block symlink escapes outside workspace root
- hide ignored files unless explicitly requested

Expansion/selection/ignored-visibility state must persist locally.

### 8.3 Explorer Branch Selection

Per-workspace branch controls must use:

- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/git/branches`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/git/switch`

Branch switching must refresh only the affected workspace explorer/search/cache
and Git path state.

### 8.4 Unified Explorer Search

Path search endpoint:

- `GET /api/workspaces/files/search?q=...&workspaceId=...&includeIgnored=...`

Content search endpoint:

- `GET /api/workspaces/files/content-search?q=...&mode=...&workspaceId=...`

Requirements:

- debounced search
- keyboard navigation with arrows, Enter, Escape
- result select expands ancestors and opens target
- content results include line/column context

### 8.5 Workspace File Operations

Workspace file APIs must support guarded open/save/diff/revert:

- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/files?path=...`
- `PUT /api/workspaces/{id}/files`
- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/files/diff?path=...`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/files/revert`

Writes must use expected-hash conflict protection.

### 8.6 Path Mutations

Explorer must support:

- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/files` (Markdown create)
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/directories` (directory create)
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/paths/rename` (rename)

Mutation guardrails:

- reject invalid names, absolute/traversal paths, `.git`, protected paths
- reject symlink mutation or out-of-root destination
- reject destination collisions
- allow Markdown create only for `.md` or `.markdown`
- return invalidated directories for targeted frontend refresh

### 8.7 Git Path Decorations and Inspector

Path status endpoint:

- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/git/path-status`

Explorer must render status for modified, added, deleted, renamed, untracked, and
conflicted paths, including ancestor aggregation.

Inspector panel must show workspace branch/health/change count, selected file
metadata, and linked item metadata when path maps to indexed item context.

## 9. Global Search, Recents, and Navigation

### 9.1 Command Palette Search

Global search is opened by `Ctrl/Cmd+K` and must support current-workspace and
all-workspaces scopes.

Search endpoint:

- `GET /api/search?q=...&workspaceId=...&types=...&limit=...`

Results must include route, subtitle/context, and ranking score.

### 9.2 Recent Items

Recent item APIs:

- `GET /api/recent-items?limit=...`
- `POST /api/recent-items`

Selecting a search result must record recents.

## 10. Reliability and State Coordination

### 10.1 Workspace Health and Audit

Health endpoint:

- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/health`

Health checks must include path availability, source availability, Git root/
conflict status, baseline branch presence, read/write permission, and indexed
item availability.

Audit endpoint:

- `GET /api/audit-events?workspaceId=...&limit=...`

Audit events must store operation, status (`success`, `blocked`, `failed`),
message, paths, duration, and error metadata.

Frontend reliability surfaces must refresh health/activity on initial mount,
explicit refresh, and `plan-manager:reliability-changed` events after write/Git
actions.

### 10.2 Stale Content Awareness

Frontend must poll `GET /api/state` every 30 seconds while visible.

When state version changes, the app must show stale notice and allow in-place
refresh.

Cross-tab signaling must use local-storage key `itemManagerContentVersion`.

## 11. Secure Content Rendering and Search Budgets

### 11.1 Content Viewer Modes

Viewer must classify and render files as:

- Markdown rendered/source
- HTML rendered/source
- JSON/YAML structured/source
- code/text source

### 11.2 Security Requirements

- Markdown rendering must sanitize HTML and use controlled plugins.
- HTML preview must sanitize via DOMPurify, strip resource-loading attributes,
  apply strict CSP, and render in sandboxed iframe.
- JSON/YAML structured mode must enforce depth/node/alias limits.
- Source code rendering must escape content and bound syntax highlighting.

Backend must reject binary/unsupported text for viewer flows.

For large files, rich preview must pause with source fallback; large text payloads
may be truncated.

### 11.3 Shared Content Search Limits

Limits for item and explorer content-search endpoints:

- min query length: 2
- max query length: 200
- max results: 100
- max files scanned: 10,000
- max bytes read: 64 MiB
- max file size: 2 MiB
- max snippet length: 240 characters

## 12. Persistence and Compatibility Requirements

### 12.1 Local App Data

App-managed files must be stored under:

`<user-config-dir>/plan-manager/`

Required files:

- `workspaces.yaml`
- `item-index.yaml`
- `audit-log.jsonl`
- `saved-filters.yaml`
- `recent-items.yaml`
- `ai-settings.yaml`

### 12.2 Startup Compatibility Migration

At startup:

- copy `repositories.yaml` to `workspaces.yaml` if target is missing
- copy `plan-index.yaml` to `item-index.yaml` if target is missing

## 13. External AI Sessions

### 13.1 Settings and Detection

Plan Manager must detect supported local AI providers and terminal applications without starting them. Machine-specific settings are stored in `ai-settings.yaml` with mode `0600` and expose:

- `GET /api/ai/capabilities`
- `GET /api/ai/settings`
- `PUT /api/ai/settings`

Launch templates accept only approved placeholders and must execute through argument arrays or validated native-terminal wrappers.

### 13.2 Item Launch

Item AI APIs:

- `GET /api/items/{id}/ai-session-eligibility`
- `POST /api/items/{id}/ai-sessions`

Context mode must be `workspace_only` or `card_context`. Workspace-only opens at the registered workspace root without provider prompt arguments and may be used from snapshot items. Card context requires an editable working-tree item but does not require `plan.yaml`; it passes the workspace-relative card path directly to the AI with a neutral instruction to read relevant documents and wait for the user's request. Neither mode creates a persistent context resource.

Provider authentication, approvals, and sandbox behavior remain owned by the provider CLI. Audit events must not record prompts, command arguments, or manifest contents.

## 14. Baseline Safety Rules

- Server must not expose remote network binding by default.
- Registry/index/audit data must be outside managed workspace paths.
- Git operations must run through timeout-bounded adapter behavior.
- Error responses may include recovery hints for blocked or stale actions.
