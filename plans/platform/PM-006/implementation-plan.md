# Implementation Plan: PM-006 - Rich Content Viewer

## Overview

Replace direct page-level Markdown rendering with one secure, extensible content viewer. Add bounded backend file classification, then add Markdown, HTML, source code, JSON, YAML, and KaTeX renderers without changing existing editing or navigation workflows.

## Terminology Lock

All code and UI text must use these names:

- `ContentViewer` for the shared preview component.
- `FileKind` for backend and frontend format groups.
- `ViewerMode` for rendered, structured, and source modes.
- `StructuredDataView` for JSON and YAML trees.
- `SourceCodeView` for highlighted source.
- `HTML Preview` for the sandboxed standalone HTML mode.

## Phases Summary

| B3    | Guarded Read Integration             | ✅     |

### Phase B3: Guarded Read Integration

**Deliverables:**

- [x] Apply classification and bounded reads in `fileaccess.Read`.

- [x] Keep `WriteMarkdown` rules and stale-write checks unchanged.
- [x] Map unsupported content to a clear API error.

**Verification:** `rtk go test ./...`

**Draft Commit:**
```text
PM-006: Integrate guarded viewer file reads

- Return classified text content
- Bound large preview responses
- Preserve Markdown write behavior
```

---

### Phase B4: Backend Regression Tests

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Cover Markdown, HTML, JSON, YAML, code, text, and unsupported files.
- [ ] Cover binary, invalid UTF-8, symlink, and maximum-size cases.
- [ ] Prove existing file tree, read, save, hash, and API routes remain stable.
- [ ] Run the complete backend suite.

**Verification:** `rtk go test ./...`

**Draft Commit:**
```text
PM-006: Add viewer backend regression tests

- Cover supported and unsupported file reads
- Cover size and binary safeguards
- Protect existing Markdown workflows
```

## Frontend Phases

### Phase F1: Viewer Types And Rendering Pipeline

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Add renderer dependencies with a reviewed lockfile diff.
- [ ] Build the sanitized GFM, KaTeX, and fenced-code pipeline.
- [ ] Build the sanitized sandboxed HTML preview.
- [ ] Add malicious-content and rendering tests.

**Verification:** `rtk npm run typecheck && rtk npm test -- --run`

- [ ] Add parse-error and large-file fallback states.

**Verification:** `rtk npm run typecheck && rtk npm test -- --run`

**Draft Commit:**
```text

### Phase F3: Shared Viewer Integration

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Integrate it into `ItemWorkspacePage`.
- [ ] Integrate it into the Kanban preview drawer.
- [ ] Remove direct `marked.parse()` and duplicate preview output.

- [ ] Add page integration tests for both surfaces.

- [ ] Lazy-load heavy format adapters and language definitions.
- [ ] Add memoization and bounded rendering for large content.
- [ ] Verify sanitization rules and iframe CSP.
- [ ] Test desktop, mobile, light theme, dark theme, drawer, and full workspace.
- [ ] Compare production bundle output and run the full build.
- [ ] Update architecture and PM-006 documents with final decisions.

- Lazy-load heavy renderers
- Complete security and visual verification
```

## Migration Strategy

1. Add API metadata without changing routes or removing fields.
2. Build renderers behind tests before changing either page.
3. Integrate the item workspace first and compare current Markdown behavior.
4. Integrate the Kanban drawer through the same component.
5. Remove direct `marked` usage only after both integrations pass.
6. Add lazy loading and size guards after functional parity is covered.
7. Keep source fallback available throughout the migration.

## Rollback Strategy

- Each phase is independently revertible.
- The old page tabs remain intact during integration.
- If a rich adapter fails, route the file to escaped source view.
- Backend fields are additive, so reverting frontend integration does not break the API.
- Do not remove `marked` until the shared Markdown renderer passes both integration suites.

## Post-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update `plans/platform/PM-006/` with final package and dependency names.
- [ ] Update architecture documentation with `features/content-viewer` ownership.
- [ ] Confirm no direct `marked.parse()` remains in page components.
- [ ] Confirm no unsanitized workspace content reaches `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- [ ] Confirm iframe sandbox has no script or same-origin permission.
- [ ] Run backend and frontend full test suites.
- [ ] Run production build and compare chunk sizes.
- [ ] Record desktop and mobile browser verification.
