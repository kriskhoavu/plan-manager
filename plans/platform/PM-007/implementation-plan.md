# Implementation Plan: PM-007 - Workspace Explorer

## Overview

Add a global filesystem explorer beside Kanban. Show every registered workspace as a root, load real directories lazily, decorate indexed item folders, preview files through PM-006, and edit Markdown with the same Preview, Raw, Diff, autosave, stale-write, and revert behavior as item details.

## Terminology Lock

All code and UI text must use these names:

- `WorkspaceExplorerPage` for the global route.
- `WorkspaceTreeEntry` for real directory and file nodes.
- `WorkspaceDirectoryListing` for immediate lazy children.
- `Workspace File` for a file addressed by workspace ID and relative path.
- `ExplorerItemDecoration` for indexed metadata on a real directory.
- `ExplorerTree` for the left workspace hierarchy pane.
- `WorkspaceFileEditor` for the center Preview, Raw, and Diff pane.
- `ExplorerInspector` for the right context pane.
- `useFileEditorSession` for shared details and Explorer edit behavior.
- `expandedNodeIds` for persisted expansion state.

## Migration Strategy

1. Add guarded directory listing without frontend exposure.
2. Add read-only workspace file APIs and safety tests.
3. Add Markdown save, diff, revert, audit, and refresh behavior.
4. Add frontend route, roots, and lazy directory state.
5. Extract shared editor behavior behind item detail regression tests.
6. Add Explorer Preview and read-only formats.
7. Enable Markdown Raw, Diff, autosave, and revert through the shared session.
8. Add item decorations, inspector, persistence, keyboard behavior, and optional virtualization.
9. Keep existing Kanban and item detail routes available throughout migration.

## Rollback Strategy

- Workspace tree and file routes are additive.
- Removing Explorer navigation restores the previous workflow.
- Existing item file routes remain unchanged.
- Item details keep the same external props and behavior after editor extraction.
- Explorer preferences are local and can be ignored or cleared.
- No managed workspace schema or item index migration is required.

## Post-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update `plans/platform/PM-007/` with final package and dependency names.
- [ ] Update architecture documentation with workspace-root file safety and editor sharing.
- [ ] Confirm `.git`, traversal, and outside symlinks are inaccessible.
- [ ] Confirm directory expansion never recursively walks unloaded descendants.
- [ ] Confirm non-Markdown files remain read-only.
- [ ] Confirm item details and Explorer share autosave, stale-write, diff, and revert behavior.
- [ ] Confirm Git mutation controls remain outside Explorer.
- [ ] Run backend and frontend full test suites.
- [ ] Run production build and compare initial and Explorer chunks.
- [ ] Record desktop, tablet, and mobile browser verification.
