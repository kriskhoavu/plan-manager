# Implementation Plan: PM-009 - Scoped Content Search

## Post-Implementation Checklist

- [x] Confirm item search cannot read sibling item directories.
- [x] Confirm Sources mode cannot search unconfigured directories.
- [x] Confirm All Files preserves PM-008 full-tree behavior.
- [x] Confirm `.git`, outside symlinks, and binary files are excluded.
- [x] Confirm ignored preference matches tree and search behavior.
- [x] Confirm path-name search remains functional in unified results.
- [x] Confirm result selection preserves pending Markdown safely.
- [x] Run full backend and frontend suites.
- [x] Run production build and record bundle output.

## Final Verification

- Backend: 147 tests passed across 26 packages.
- Frontend: 66 tests passed across 22 files.
- Production: main JavaScript 315.89 kB (91.68 kB gzip); main CSS 70.44 kB (12.63 kB gzip).
- Dependencies: Go modules verified and the npm dependency tree resolved; npm audit was unavailable because the configured internal registry did not resolve.
- Browser automation: unavailable in this session; component tests cover keyboard controls, mode switching, highlighting, and responsive state structure.
