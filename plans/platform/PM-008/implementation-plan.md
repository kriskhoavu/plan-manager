## Backend Phases

### Phase B1: Guarded Create And Rename Domain

**Deliverables:**

- [x] Add create, rename, and mutation result models.
- [x] Add single-segment name validation.
- [x] Add exclusive Markdown creation and one-directory creation.
- [x] Add guarded same-workspace rename without overwrite.
- [x] Return precise parent cache invalidation paths.
- [x] Cover traversal, `.git`, symlink, format, collision, and root safeguards.

**Verification:** `rtk go test ./internal/workspacefiles ./internal/security/pathguard`

**Draft Commit:**

```

## Frontend Phases

### Phase F1: Types And API Clients

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Add search, Git state, create, rename, and mutation result types.

**Verification:** `rtk npm run typecheck && rtk npm test -- --run`

**Draft Commit:**
```text
PM-008: Add Explorer productivity contracts

- Add path search and Git state clients
- Add create and rename clients
- Normalize optional response collections
```

### Phase F2: Search, Git, And Mutation State

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Add debounced cancellable search state.
- [ ] Add Git path state normalization and loading.
- [ ] Add create and rename mutation state.
- [ ] Add targeted directory cache invalidation.
- [ ] Add expand-to-result behavior.
- [ ] Add helper and hook tests.

**Verification:** `rtk npm run typecheck && rtk npm test -- --run`

**Draft Commit:**

- Cache Git decorations by path
- Refresh targeted directories after mutations
```

### Phase F3: Explorer Productivity UI

**Deliverables:**

```

## Post-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Confirm no operation can expose or modify `.git`.
- [ ] Confirm search and rename cannot follow outside symlinks.
- [ ] Confirm create and rename never overwrite a destination.
- [ ] Confirm ignored mode controls search and tree behavior consistently.
- [ ] Confirm Git status uses one call per workspace refresh.
- [ ] Confirm item editor and PM-007 Explorer regressions pass.
- [ ] Run full backend and frontend suites.
- [ ] Run the production build and record bundle output.
