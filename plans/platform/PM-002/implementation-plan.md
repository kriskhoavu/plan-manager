# Implementation Plan: PM-002 - Plan Editing And Git Operations

## Overview

Implement safe plan authoring and guarded Git operations for the local Plan Manager app.

PM-002 builds on PM-001. It keeps existing read APIs stable and adds write APIs, editor UI, metadata editing, new plan creation, status moves, and Git controls.

## Terminology Lock

All code, API fields, and UI labels must use:

- `Repository`
- `Plan`
- `Plan Directory`
- `Plan Metadata`
- `Edit Session`
- `Dirty State`
- `Write Guard`
- `Git Operation`
- `Commit Draft`
- `Branch Operation`

Avoid:

- `Project` for registered repositories.
- `Task` for plans.
- `Sync` when the operation is specifically `Scan`, `Fetch`, `Pull`, or `Push`.
- `Auto Save` because PM-002 saves only when the user clicks Save.

## Implementation Clarifications

- PM-002 is a full authoring MVP.
- It supports Markdown editing, metadata editing, status moves, new plan creation, commit, pull, push, fetch, branch create, and branch switch.
- Write APIs must validate repository scope, plan scope, file scope, and symlink safety.
- Freestyle docs roots support Markdown editing only.
- Structured plans support Markdown and metadata editing.
- Structured plans without `plan.yaml` can get a generated `plan.yaml` when metadata or status changes.
- Commit operations stage and commit only selected plan paths.
- Pull, push, and branch switch use guard-and-confirm behavior.
- The app does not add background auto-fetch.
- The app never stores Git credentials.
- After successful content writes, the affected repository is rescanned.

## Backend Phases

### Phase B1: Write-Safe Domain And Models

**Deliverables:**

- [x] Add request and response models for file save, metadata save, status update, new plan, Git status, commit, and branch operations.
- [x] Add Git change models for dirty, staged, untracked, conflicted, ahead, behind, and upstream state.
- [x] Add validation helpers for editable status values, branch names, commit messages, service names, and ticket names.
- [x] Add tests for validation rules.

**Verification:** `rtk go test ./...`

**Draft Commit:**

### Phase B2: File And Metadata Write Services

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Add safe file writer that resolves file IDs through the plan file tree or document list.
- [ ] Add Markdown file save with expected hash support.
- [ ] Add metadata writer for `plan.yaml`.
- [ ] Add status update writer for Kanban moves.
- [ ] Add structured plan creator with starter `README.md`, scenario folder, design folder, implementation plan, and `plan.yaml`.
- [ ] Rescan the affected repository after successful writes.
- [ ] Add tests for path traversal, symlink escape, docs root behavior, metadata creation, and duplicate plan creation.

**Verification:** `rtk go test ./...`

**Draft Commit:**
```text

### Phase B3: Git Operation APIs

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Extend Git adapter with status, fetch, pull, push, commit, branch create, and branch switch.
- [ ] Add write guards for conflicts, dirty state, divergence, and selected path scope.
- [ ] Add repository Git API endpoints.
- [ ] Add plan file, metadata, status, and new plan API endpoints.
- [ ] Return clear operation results with updated Git status.
- [ ] Add tests for guarded operation behavior and API errors.

**Verification:** `rtk go test ./...`

**Draft Commit:**
```text
PM-002: Add guarded Git APIs

---

### Phase B4: Index Refresh And Stale-State Integration

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Ensure successful writes update the plan index and app state version.
- [ ] Ensure Git content changes rescan the affected repository.
- [ ] Ensure failed writes do not mutate the index.
- [ ] Keep PM-001 read APIs stable.
- [ ] Add tests for app state version changes after writes.

**Verification:** `rtk go test ./...`

**Draft Commit:**
```text
PM-002: Refresh index after writes

- Rescan repositories after content changes
- Update app state version for write operations
- Preserve existing read API behavior
```

- [ ] Normalize optional response fields.
- [ ] Add focused API client tests where current test setup supports them.

**Verification:** `rtk npm run typecheck && rtk npm test -- --run`
