# PM-001: Plan Manager Read-Only MVP

## Overview

Plan Manager is a local Git-native web app for browsing planning documents.

The MVP lets a developer register local repositories as workspaces, scan one or more plan roots, view one active workspace on a Kanban board, and open a workspace with a file tree, Markdown preview, raw Markdown view, metadata, and read-only Git diff.

The MVP is read-only for managed repositories. It does not edit plan files. It does not run Git write operations. It only writes Plan Manager registry and cache files in the app data directory.

## Data Flow

```text
Developer starts Plan Manager
  -> backend loads app config from user data directory
  -> frontend asks for repositories
  -> developer selects one active workspace from the left nav
  -> developer registers or edits this repo and plan directories
  -> backend validates Git repo, branch, and folders
  -> developer triggers Scan
  -> scanner reads local branches and working tree
  -> scanner indexes structured plan folders and freestyle docs roots
  -> scanner reads plan.yaml first when present
  -> scanner falls back to folder and README parsing when plan.yaml is missing
  -> app state version changes after registry or index updates
  -> other tabs show a refresh popup instead of auto-reloading
  -> frontend renders board columns, filter facets, and cards
  -> developer opens a card
  -> frontend loads file tree, file content, metadata, and diff
```

## Design Decisions

| Decision                                    | Alternatives Considered                     | Rationale                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use Go plus React/Vite                      | Node-only, Rust plus React                  | Go gives a simple local binary and strong filesystem/Git access. React/Vite fits the proposed UI.                                   |
| Store app data outside managed repos        | Store config in each repo, config file only | The app should not dirty target repositories. A cache is needed for large plan sets.                                                |
| Make v1 read-only                           | Editable workspace, full Git manager        | Read-only browsing gives value first and avoids save, lock, credential, and branch mutation risks.                                  |
| Use `plan.yaml` first                       | README-only parsing                         | Existing plans already use `plan.yaml`. It gives stable metadata. File explorer order is filesystem-based.                          |
| Add fallback parsing                        | Require `plan.yaml`                         | Older plans and custom folders should still appear as normal plan cards with inferred metadata.                                     |
| Support freestyle docs roots                | Force docs into `service/ticket` structure  | General docs folders such as `docs/` should be browsable without fake tickets.                                                      |
| Scope Kanban to one active workspace        | Mix all repositories on one board           | A board should represent one project workspace. Repository switching belongs in the left nav.                                       |
| Use client-side multi-select board filters  | Add many query params to `/api/plans`       | The board loads cached summaries for the active workspace. Source, status, author, and branch facets give OR filters without churn. |
| Show stale-content prompt                   | Auto-reload pages                           | Reading and detail views should not be interrupted. Users decide when to refresh in-place.                                          |
| Keep repository edit/delete app-local       | Treat registry changes as managed repo ops  | Registry writes only touch Plan Manager data. They do not modify registered repositories.                                           |
| Do not auto fetch in v1                     | Fetch every 15 seconds                      | Fetch changes `.git` refs and can trigger credentials. Manual scan is safer for v1.                                                 |
| Treat `specs/design.png` as visual baseline | Treat image as inspiration only             | The UI must not drift away from the documented proposal.                                                                            |
| Use Playwright MCP as a phase gate          | Manual browser checks only                  | AI-agent-run browser checks make layout and workflow regressions visible during development.                                        |

## Implementation Clarifications

- PM-001 should support at least 100 repositories, 10,000 plans, and 100,000 files through cached plan summaries.
- Board and list views must read from cached metadata. They must not load every Markdown file on each render.
- File content should load only when the user opens a plan file.
- Backend code should keep clear boundaries between repository registry, Git access, scanning, indexing, and HTTP handlers.
- HTTP handlers must not read arbitrary filesystem paths directly. They must go through the plan index and file access layer.
- Manual Scan rebuilds derived metadata for one repository.
- Repository edit updates app registry metadata after validation.
- Repository delete removes the app registry entry and cached plans for that repository.
- Kanban shows one active repository/workspace at a time.
- Kanban can filter by configured source root, such as `plans` or `docs`.
- Registry and plan-index changes update the app state version.
- When another tab changes content, existing tabs show a top-right refresh popup.
- The refresh popup reloads app data in place and does not refresh the whole browser page.
- A bad plan creates a scan warning. It must not fail the whole repository scan.
- The app must not write to registered repositories in PM-001.
- File reads must stay inside configured plan directories.
- Structured plan roots use `service/ticket` folders.
- Freestyle docs roots with Markdown files are indexed as docs items.
- The UI exposes only simple content labels: Plan and Docs.
- Kanban filters support OR within a facet and AND across facets.
- The UI should match the layout, density, navigation, and mobile behavior of `specs/design.png`. It does not need pixel-perfect parity.

## Next Plan

After PM-001 is complete, create `PM-002: Plan Editing And Git Operations`.

PM-002 should turn the read-only workspace into a safe authoring workflow. It should cover Markdown editing, status moves, new plan creation, commit, pull, push, branch create, branch switch, dirty-state handling, and write-operation safeguards.

PM-002 should reuse the PM-001 terminology and APIs where possible. It should add write APIs only after the read-only scan, board, workspace, and Playwright MCP acceptance flow are stable.
