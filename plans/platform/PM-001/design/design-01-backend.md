# Backend Design: PM-001

## Goals

- Run a local HTTP API for Plan Manager.
- Register, edit, and remove local Git repositories.
- Scan structured plan folders and freestyle documentation roots without writing to managed repositories.
- Serve board, workspace, file, and diff data.
- Cache scan results for fast startup and filtering.
- Support native local path selection and reveal actions for repository management.

## Scan Rules

- Validate the repository path before scanning.
- Scan local branches and the current working tree only.
- Do not run `git fetch` in v1.
- Do not create, switch, delete, or push branches.
- A repository may configure multiple plan directories.
- For structured roots, discover plans under `service/ticket` folders.
- Read `plan.yaml` first for structured plan folders.
- If `plan.yaml` is missing in a structured folder, create a hybrid plan and infer:
  - service from the first folder under a plan root.
  - ticket from the plan folder name.
  - title from the first README heading.
  - status from implementation-plan status text when possible.
- If a configured root contains Markdown but does not match the structured plan shape, index it as a docs item.
- Documentation collections use `metadataSource: docs`, a docs-oriented display type, and inferred title/description from Markdown headings.
- Map missing or unknown status to `draft`.
- Store scan warnings and expose them in scan results.
- Preserve the configured plan directory in plan ids and file access metadata so duplicate paths stay unique.

## Cache Rules

- Manual Scan rebuilds derived metadata for one repository.
- Removing a repository removes its cached plans, warnings, and scan metadata.
- App state version changes when repository registry or cached plan summaries change.
- Board and list APIs read from cached summaries.
- Plan detail APIs read cached metadata and load file content on demand.
- Cache stores plan summaries, document metadata, scan timestamps, warnings, and errors.
- Cache should not store full Markdown file content in PM-001.
- A failed plan parse creates a warning and does not stop the repository scan.

## Backend Boundaries

| Boundary             | Responsibility                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `RepositoryRegistry` | Store and validate registered repositories |
| `GitAdapter`         | Run allowed read-only Git commands         |
| `PlanScanner`        | Discover plans and parse metadata          |
| `PlanIndex`          | Store and query cached scan results        |
| `FileAccess`         | Read files only through indexed plan paths |
| `PlanAPI`            | Convert backend data into HTTP responses   |
| `SystemAPI`          | Directory picker and path reveal actions   |

HTTP handlers must not read arbitrary filesystem paths directly.

## Git Adapter

| Operation           | Command Shape                               | Write Risk |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Validate repo       | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`             | None       |
| Validate branch     | `git show-ref --verify refs/heads/{branch}` | None       |
| List local branches | `git for-each-ref refs/heads`               | None       |
| Last author         | `git log -1 --format=%an -- {path}`         | None       |
| Last update         | `git log -1 --format=%cI -- {path}`         | None       |
| Diff                | `git diff -- {path}`                        | None       |

## Error Handling

- Repository validation errors block registration.
- Scan warnings do not block other plans.
- File read errors show a workspace error state for that file.
- Git command failures are returned with a user-safe message.
- The backend logs command details locally for debugging.

## Security Rules

- File reads must stay inside configured plan directories.
- Path traversal must be rejected.
- Symlinks that escape configured plan directories must be rejected.
- Native directory selection and reveal actions must not grant file read access by themselves.
- Repository registry writes are limited to app-local config and cache files.
- PM-001 must not expose write APIs for registered repositories.
- PM-001 must not run Git commands that change refs, branches, remotes, index, or working tree.

## Verification

- Unit test metadata parsing and fallback parsing.
- Unit test freestyle documentation root discovery.
- Unit test status normalization.
- Unit test repository update/delete cache behavior.
- Integration test this repository as a fixture.
- Verify no backend test writes to managed plan folders.
