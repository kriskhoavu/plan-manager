# Implementation Plan: PM-001 - Plan Manager Read-Only MVP

## Overview

Implement a local read-only Plan Manager app.

The MVP registers local Git repositories as workspaces, scans one or more configured plan or documentation roots, renders the active workspace on a Kanban board, and opens a read-only workspace for plan files. It follows `specs/requirement.md` for behavior and `specs/design.png` for the visual baseline.

## Terminology Lock

All code, API fields, and UI labels must use:

- `Repository`
- `RepositoryConfig`
- `Plan`
- `PlanSummary`
- `PlanDetail`
- `PlanDocument`
- `PlanStatus`
- `Plan Directory`
- `Structured Plan Root`
- `Freestyle Docs Root`
- `Scan`
- `Workspace`

Avoid:

- `Project` for registered Git repositories.
- `Task` for plans.
- `Sync` for read-only scan unless Git fetch is added later.

## Implementation Clarifications

- Support at least 100 repositories, 10,000 plans, and 100,000 files through cached metadata.
- Board and list views must use cached plan summaries.
- File content must load only when a user opens a plan file.
- Manual Scan rebuilds derived metadata for one repository.
- A repository can have multiple plan directories, such as `plans`, `docs`, or `docs/plans`.
- A structured plan root uses the `service/ticket` folder shape and usually contains `plan.yaml`.
- A structured plan folder that is missing `plan.yaml` still appears as a normal plan card with inferred metadata.
- A freestyle docs root is indexed as a docs item even when it has Markdown files but no plan folder structure.
- A bad plan creates a scan warning and must not fail the whole scan.
- Keep backend boundaries between `RepositoryRegistry`, `GitAdapter`, `PlanScanner`, `PlanIndex`, `FileAccess`, and `PlanAPI`.
- HTTP handlers must not read arbitrary filesystem paths directly.
- File reads must stay inside configured plan directories.
- PM-001 must not expose Git or file write operations.
- Repository create, edit, delete, path browse, and path reveal actions write only app registry or cache data, not managed repositories.
- Repository and plan-index changes expose an app state version for stale-content detection.
- Kanban is scoped to one active repository/workspace selected from the left navigation.
- Kanban can filter cards by configured source root, such as `plans` or `docs`.
- Kanban filters are multi-select: options are OR-matched within a filter group and AND-matched across groups.
- UI parity means matching the proposal layout, density, navigation, and mobile behavior. Pixel-perfect matching is not required.
