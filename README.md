# Plan Manager

Plan Manager is a local, Git-native web application for browsing and editing planning documents across repositories and
workspaces. It turns file-based plans into a workflow-oriented UI without moving content out of Git.

It is designed for engineers who want faster visibility, safer edits, and cleaner Git operations when plans and specs
are stored as Markdown.

## Why Plan Manager

Teams often keep plans in Git because it gives strong review, ownership, and history. The tradeoff is discoverability
and flow: progress is hard to track across folders, branches, and multiple repositories.

Plan Manager addresses that gap by providing:

- A Kanban view over document-backed items
- Multi-workspace and multi-source support (`plans`, `docs`, `specs`, etc.)
- One place to edit Markdown, metadata, status, and related files
- Built-in Git actions with guardrails for risky operations
- App-owned index and state outside managed repositories

## Feature Highlights

- Register workspaces from local paths or remote Git URLs (HTTPS/SSH)
- Configure one or more sources per workspace
- Index structured items, configured docs, and freestyle docs in one board
- Keep unmatched docs in an `Unsorted` lane until mapping rules are added
- Filter board items by source, status, author, branch, and free text
- Open item workspaces with file tree, rich preview, markdown editor, metadata, and diff
- Autosave Markdown edits with stale-write protection
- Edit item metadata and move status from either board or metadata form
- Create new structured items
- Search indexed items across one or all workspaces with keyboard navigation
- Save and restore Kanban filter views
- Reopen recently viewed items quickly
- Use guarded Git flows for commit, fetch, pull, push, branch create/switch
- Inspect workspace health and recent operation history
- Detect local Claude, Codex, Copilot, and OpenCode CLIs
- Launch Terminal, iTerm2, or WezTerm with workspace-only or selected-card context

## Requirements

- Go `1.22+`
- Node.js `20+`
- npm
- Git

Platform-specific tools used for native folder selection and path reveal:

- macOS: `osascript`, `open`
- Windows: PowerShell, Explorer
- Linux: `zenity` or `kdialog` (picker), `xdg-open` (reveal)

External AI session launch currently supports macOS Terminal, iTerm2, and WezTerm. Install and authenticate at least one supported AI CLI separately. Plan Manager does not bypass the CLI's permission prompts or sandbox.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
go build -o ./bin/plan-manager ./cmd/plan-manager
./bin/plan-manager serve -port 4317
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4317`.

Default port is `4317`. You can also set `PLAN_MANAGER_PORT`:

```bash
PLAN_MANAGER_PORT=4317 ./bin/plan-manager serve
```

## Install With Homebrew (macOS)

For macOS users, Plan Manager can be installed from the public tap:

```bash
brew update
brew tap kriskhoavu/homebrew-tap
brew install plan-manager
```

Run the app:

```bash
plan-manager serve -port 4317
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4317` in your browser.

Run in the background (optional):

```bash
nohup plan-manager serve -port 4317 >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Stop the app:

```bash
pkill -f "plan-manager serve"
```

If running in the foreground, press `Ctrl+C` in the same terminal.

Validate the installed formula:

```bash
plan-manager doctor
brew test plan-manager
```

Notes:

- Homebrew formula support is currently macOS only.
- Use `brew upgrade plan-manager` for updates.

## Development

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --run
go test ./...
```

Useful build commands:

```bash
npm run build
go build -o ./bin/plan-manager ./cmd/plan-manager
```

## CLI Commands

```text
plan-manager serve [-port 4317]
plan-manager doctor [--provider github|bitbucket] [--repo <path-or-url>] [--format text|json] [--strict] [--port <n>]
```

- `serve`: starts the local app server (binds to `127.0.0.1`)
- `doctor`: runs environment and repository checks for troubleshooting and setup validation

## Data Directory and Settings

Plan Manager stores app-owned state in a user-level data directory (resolved via `os.UserConfigDir()`).

Typical defaults:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/plan-manager/`
- Linux: `~/.config/plan-manager/`
- Windows: `%AppData%\plan-manager\`

Resolution order at startup:

1. `PLAN_MANAGER_DATA_DIR` environment variable
2. `bootstrap.yaml` override in the default OS data directory
3. Default OS data directory

When changed from the UI, override is written to:

```text
<default-os-data-dir>/bootstrap.yaml
```

Example:

```yaml
dataDir: /Users/me/.plan-manager-data
```

Changing `dataDir` requires a restart.

AI settings contain executable paths and argument templates only. Workspace-only sessions open at the workspace root without generated context, allowing manual file and directory references. Selected-card sessions pass the card's workspace-relative path directly to the AI, which can read relevant documents from that directory before waiting for the user's request. No context file or directory is created.

### Data Directory Structure

```text
<effective-data-dir>/
  bootstrap.yaml
  workspaces.yaml
  item-index.yaml
  audit-log.jsonl
  saved-filters.yaml
  recent-items.yaml
  ai-settings.yaml
  clone-root/
```

### Workspace-Level Files

- `workspace-settings.yaml`: source mapping rules for non-standard docs layouts
- `repository-settings.yaml`: legacy alias still supported
- `plan.yaml`: item metadata (`status`, owner, tags, title, document overrides)

`workspace-settings.yaml` example:

```yaml
version: 1
cards:
  - pathPattern: "{folder}/feature/{item}"
    fields:
      source: docs
      item: "{item}"
      title: readme_heading
      status: draft
      tags: [docs]
```

If source settings are missing or invalid, Plan Manager falls back to freestyle docs handling.

## Safety Model

- Local-only server bind (`127.0.0.1`)
- Writes restricted to configured sources
- Markdown stale-write detection via expected content hashes
- Metadata writes limited to structured/configured items
- Commit stages only user-selected paths within configured sources
- Pull and branch switch protect dirty trees unless risk is explicitly confirmed
- No credential storage

Plan Manager writes into managed repositories only for explicit user actions (edit, metadata/status update, item
creation, source settings save, commit/pull/push, branch operations). Registry and cache remain app-owned.
