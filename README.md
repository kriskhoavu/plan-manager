# Plan Manager

Plan Manager is a local Git-native web app for browsing planning documents across repositories.

It helps developers and technical leads turn folder-based planning docs into a workspace with a Kanban board, repository management, file explorer, Markdown preview, raw file view, metadata, and read-only Git diff.

## Business Point Of View

Engineering plans often live in Git as Markdown files. That is good for review, history, and ownership, but it is hard to see progress across many branches, services, and repositories.

Plan Manager gives those files a product-management view without moving them out of Git.

It solves these problems:

- Teams can browse plans without manually walking folders and branches.
- A repository can expose multiple plan sources, such as `plans` and `docs`.
- Structured plans and freestyle docs can appear in the same workspace.
- Developers can inspect planning context, implementation phases, files, and local diffs in one place.
- The app stores its own registry and cache outside managed repositories, so scanning does not dirty target repos.

## Vision

The long-term vision is a local authoring workspace for Git-based planning.

Current PM-001 capabilities are read-only:

- Register local Git repositories.
- Configure one or more plan directories.
- Scan structured plan roots and freestyle docs roots.
- View one active repository workspace at a time.
- Browse a Kanban board by status.
- Filter by source, status, author, branch, and text.
- Open a preview drawer from a board card.
- Open a plan workspace with file tree, Markdown preview, raw Markdown, plan info, and diff.
- Edit and delete repository registrations.
- Reveal local paths in Finder, Windows Explorer, or the Linux file manager.
- Show a stale-content popup when app state changes in another tab.

PM-002 is planned as the editing and Git operations MVP:

- Markdown editing.
- Plan metadata editing.
- Status moves.
- New plan creation.
- Commit, pull, push, fetch, branch create, and branch switch.
- Guarded write operations.

```

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or newer.
- Node.js 20 or newer.
- npm.
- Git.

Native path selection also uses platform tools:

- macOS: `osascript` and `open`.
- Windows: PowerShell and Explorer.
- Linux: `zenity` or `kdialog` for folder selection, and `xdg-open` for path reveal.

## Run The Application

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build the local binary:

```bash
go build -o ./bin/plan-manager ./cmd/plan-manager
```

Run the app:

```bash
./bin/plan-manager serve -port 4317
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4317
```

The default port is `4317`. You can also set `PLAN_MANAGER_PORT`:

```bash
PLAN_MANAGER_PORT=4317 ./bin/plan-manager serve
```

## Development Commands

Run frontend typecheck:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Run frontend tests:

```bash
npm test -- --run
```

Run backend tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Build production frontend assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build the app binary:

```bash
go build -o ./bin/plan-manager ./cmd/plan-manager
```

## Data Location

Plan Manager stores its app data in the OS user config directory:

```text
<user-config-dir>/plan-manager/
  repositories.yaml
  plan-index.yaml
```

Examples:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/plan-manager/`
- Linux: usually `~/.config/plan-manager/`
- Windows: usually `%AppData%\plan-manager\`

Registered repositories are not used as app storage. In PM-001, the app does not write to managed repositories.

## Current Safety Model

- The app binds to `127.0.0.1`.
- PM-001 is read-only for managed repositories.
- Registry and cache writes go to the app config directory.
- File reads are restricted to configured plan directories.
- Diff uses read-only `git diff`.
- No credentials are stored.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design details.
